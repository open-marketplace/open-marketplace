**Please note: this project is being reborn from ashes at the moment! Many links point to the deleted repository owned by BitBagCommerce for now, but this will be changed.**

Open Marketplace is the first open-source marketplace platform. The solution is based on Sylius, Symfony and Semantic UI meaning it is fully compatible with each. The platform is a highly customizable project made using full-stack BDD with Behat and PHPSpec.
